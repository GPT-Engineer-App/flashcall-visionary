exports.startRecording = (callId) => {
    // Logic to start recording the call
    console.log(`Starting recording for call ${callId}`);
};

    // Logic to stop recording the call and save the recording path
    console.log(`Stopping recording for call ${callId}`);
};

exports.getRecording = (callId) => {
    // Logic to retrieve the recording file path
    const recordingPath = path.resolve(__dirname, `../recordings/${callId}.mp4`);
    if (fs.existsSync(recordingPath)) {
        return recordingPath;
    }
    return null;
};
```
